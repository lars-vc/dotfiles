# Dunst configfiles
Dunst is a notification daemon and includes `dunstify` to send notifications too (is compatible with `notify-send`).
![screenshot1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lars-vc/dotfiles/root/private_dot_config/dunst/screenshot.png)

Uses the [alertdiscord.sh](https://github.com/lars-vc/dotfiles/blob/root/private_dot_config/dunst/executable_alertdiscord.sh) script to make the discord app "urgent" when a notification appears (therefore discord desktop notifications need to be on, however dunst will hide that notification because of the skip_display option).
